5.Express install 
6.const express = require('express'),const app =express(),const port = 8000; and using app.listen in index js
7.We inside package.json inside scripts chnages start = nodemon index.js it means now if i run npm start it will work same as I run nodemon index.js

9.As nodemodules files is too heavy i make a gitignore file and specify path of it inside this file,now git wont track it.
10.Now added changes by git add . and commited the changes.
9.In routes folder in which we create a index.js file which will have routes10.
10.Some Commands at top and after that module.exports to export this file to index.js
11.In index.js root  we created a middleware which calls on route every time server starts.
12.To check routes is working just console.log at routes index.js and see the terminal for confirmation 
13.Now whem we write app.get or post we specify a route and a function.When these function or actions are written in collection is called controllers.
14.We created home_controller file in controller folder and made a home named object which returned h1 .
15.Now we went to routes and mentioned const homeController = require('../controllers/home_controller') in index js; now we write a route.get(....) to initialize it.
16.localhost8000 gives result as output from controller.
